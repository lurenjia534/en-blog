## Seeking a Balance: Openness and Security, Freedom and Privacy

We aim for open system and kernel source code while also being committed to digital forensics security. We demand a smooth system but also wish our privacy and freedom to be protected. Admittedly, this creates a contradiction.

## Pixel: A Strong Contender

In my opinion, Pixel has indeed accomplished this balance. Being a niche phone under Google, Pixel features the latest system specifications.

### Open-Source Kernel

Pixel excels particularly in terms of its open-source kernel. It provides documentation on how to pull repo kernel source code and offers compilation scripts. It also actively updates the complete kernel source code.

### Digital Security

Its digital security is well-assured. To this day, the T2 security chip remains the safest standalone chip for civilian use.

### Privacy and Freedom

In terms of privacy and freedom, Google also affords users a high degree of freedom. Pixel allows the bootloader to be freely unlocked and has stored the device tree on cs.android.com, enabling users to freely adapt any system based on AOSP.

### Conclusion

Although Google has not opened the source code for Pixel's system, it has nonetheless open-sourced the base system's source code, which is AOSP. In summary, Pixel has indeed delivered a satisfactory report card in the realms of open-source, freedom, privacy, development, security, smoothness, and updates.
